ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @polarteddybear (Daniel).

 Iâ€™m interested in Data Analysis and Statistics, research methodology, network analysis and social science.
 Iâ€™m currently learning Data Anaylsis Using Python and R.
 Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project that I find intresting and suitable for my set of skills.
 I am sharing some of my projects and learning in this page and would love to hear some input and learn new things.
